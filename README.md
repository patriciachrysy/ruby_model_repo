To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

### Setup

- Clone the repository on your local machine
- cd into the folder, find the ibubble_sort.rb file an open it in code editor

### Install

- Install VSCode or any code editor you like
- Install Ruby(most recent version)
- Run this command on your terminal in order to install rubocop: gem install rubocop 

### Usage

### Run tests

- add code lines to bubble_sort.rb file
   * `p bubble_sort([4, 3, 78, 2, 0, 2])` (sort in ascending order)
   * `p bubble_sort(["hi","hello","hey"])` (sort in alphabetic order)
   * `p bubble_sort_by([4, 3, 78, 2, 0, 2]) { |first, second| first <=> second }` (sort in ascending order)
   * `p bubble_sort_by(["hi","hello","hey"]) { |first, second| first <=> second }` (sort in alphabetic order)
   * `p bubble_sort_by(["hi","hello","hey"]) { |first, second| first.length - second.length }`(sort in ascending string length order)
